# tipr-second-assignment
Hola, amigos! Welcome to the second assignment of TIPR-2019.
Multi layer perceptron neural network is implemented from scratch and also using keras library.
MLNN implemented is configurable through keyboard inputs.
Since, the runtime is too large, many results in the report are done using a subset of the original dataset.
All the tasks have been performed and corresponding results and inferences are listed in the repor.
The output plots obtained for the first 2 parts are provided in the file outputplots.
Codes are attached in src file.
MPLkeras1 is the .py file used to implement MLNN using keras library. 
othercvfiles is the .py file used to perform task 3 with dataset mlpforcv
